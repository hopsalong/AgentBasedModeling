# Part 1

I decided to do my analysis on Guinea, primarily because it's population density is large enough to provide for interesting analysis, but still small enough for my computer to run. First I plotted a map showing the population of each prefecture in Boke (the region I had decided to focus on). I then created a plot using the geom_bar function that presents the same information, on the population of each prefecture in Boke, except in bar plot version (and with some other differences like the percent of total population that's ncluded in the bar graph). Both of these plots were very helpful for me in terms of deciding which prefecture to use for the next stage of the project.

# Part 2
These plots shows the population of Koundara, the prefecture I decided to focus on in Boke. The first was done by plotting a population raster on top of a map shapefile. The second was done by creating a window object of the shapefile, using it to calculate the population density with rpoint, and then plotting them on top of one another.
