   Maurizio Porfiri, a professor at NYU, just a few days ago published the findings of his new spatial data analytics approach. 
  It applies mathematic time series techniques to create a non-parametric for discovering spatial dependencies. They are 
  essentially looking at the relationships between individual nodes; how is the measurement of node x changed by it’s 
  neighbors? The non-parametric approach gives a lot of flexibility. For instance, Porfiri explains that California and New 
  York might be neighbors of each other, even though they are not spatially next to each other, but there are other variables 
  that could make them similar. The technique is designed to allow you to make observations with very few data points (they use 
  a range of around 25-100). This makes it an incredibly powerful and useful tool, since good data can be so hard to come by 
  and very expensive to produce. There are also cases where you are going to be stuck with a small data set. For instance, 
  Porfiri used his method to look at the distribution of drinking and driving accidents by state. Since there are only so many 
  states, there is only so much data you can get, and yet this method allows you to really get a good look at the individual 
  relationships.
  
   This technique has a lot of potential in the world of human development. Data is very hard to come by in human development 
  research, and researchers are often left to work with less than optimal datasets, so something like this which is perfectly 
  tailored to making to most out of a small dataset is ideal. The aspect of looking at the underlying connections between nodes 
  is something not just useful for human development, but universally useful. Although it should be noted that this technique has 
  already been proved successful in human development. Porfiri tested it by looking at migration in Bangladesh, and to what extent 
  it is affected by current population size and geographic distance. The results were promising, indicating that the technique 
  could be used for similar things in the future.
